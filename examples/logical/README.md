# Logical Operators

Please note that some operators in this category were not demonstrated because their usage can be derived easily from their sibling operators which are demonstrated.

For example, the use of `[nei]` can be derived from `[ne]`, also, the use of `[gte]`, `[lte]` and `[lt]` can be derived from `[gt]`.
